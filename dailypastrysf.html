Daily Pastry is a joint venture between Santa Fe locals Lowell Bartlett and Bryce Delamater.
They have been longtime friends since the age of 9, and started baking pies together shortly
afterwards. They are the winners of multiple years of the Seton Village Pie Baking Contest,
with both individual and joint entries. They decided to put their talents to use in a commercial
setting, and are now open for business as a wholesale bakery! From whole pies, to their unique
and trademarked HandPie, to a range of muffins and other baked goods, they offer a diverse
selection of pastry available for delivery hot or cold.
